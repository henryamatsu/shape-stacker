# Personal Express App: Shape Stacker

A full stack app that lets you create and position a variety of shapes. The app will remember the shapes you've made and how you've positioned them.

## How Itâ€™s Made

**Tech Stack:**  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Frontend:** EJS, HTML, CSS, JS  

## How It Works
- When a user clicks the **New Shape** button, either a circle or square with a random size and color is generated on the page
- You can click on a shape and drag it to change its position, and its z-index will update so that the most recently clicked shape will always appear in front of all other shapes
- The shapes are stored in the associated database so that the same shapes appear for all users
- There is a limit of 10 concurrent shapes, after which the **New Shape** button will delete the oldest shape to make room for a new one
